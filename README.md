# Text Classification and Transformation of Book Reviews

<sup>In association with Cornell Tech and Break Through Tech AI</sup>

In this Python project, I conducted sentiment analysis on book reviews. The dataset was divided 80% for training and 20% for testing. I utilized the TF-IDF algorithm for feature extraction. I considered both individual words as well as two-word combinations. I also experimented with term frequencies to optimize feature selection. I used a logistic regression model and combined all steps into a single machine learning pipeline. The model's accuracy was assessed with an ROC curve.
